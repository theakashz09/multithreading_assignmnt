    "Ans. In python Multithreding is a programming technique that allows multiple threads to run concurrently within a single process. this means that multiple tasks can be executed at the same time which can improve the performance of program.\n",
    "the threading module in python is used to handle threads. It provide a number of classes and functions that we can use to create manage and communicate with threads. the benifits of using multithreading in python that it can pmprrove the performance of the program by allowing multiople tasks to be executed at the same time \n",
    "multithreading can help to keep application responsive while it is running a background task. this is because the backgraound task can be run in a separate thread so it will not block the main thrad "
